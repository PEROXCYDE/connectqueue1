## üì• Installation

1. üìÇ Extract the folder into your `resources` directory.
2. üìú Add `start connectqueue` to your `server.cfg` (preferably at the top).
3. üîß Configure ConVars as needed.
4. ‚úèÔ∏è Open `connectqueue/server/sv_queue_config.lua` and customize it to your needs.

> **Note:** Renaming the resource folder may cause issues.

## üîß ConVars

Set the following ConVars in your `server.cfg`:

```bash
set sv_debugqueue true    # Enables debug messages in the console
set sv_displayqueue true  # Displays the queue count in the server name '[count] server name'
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage and Examples

### üö¶ OnReady

This event is triggered when the queue functions are ready to be used.

```lua
Queue.OnReady(function() 
    print("Queue system is ready!")
end)
```

### üö™ OnJoin

This event is triggered when a player attempts to join the server. The `allow` function controls their access. If `allow` is called with a string, the player is denied entry with the given message.

```lua
Queue.OnJoin(function(source, allow)
    allow("Sorry, you cannot join at this time.")
end)
```

### üéüÔ∏è AddPriority

Adds a player identifier to the priority list with a specified power level, either individually or in a table.

```lua
-- Individual priority
Queue.AddPriority("STEAM_0:1:33459672", 100)
Queue.AddPriority("steam:110000103fd1bb1", 10)
Queue.AddPriority("ip:127.0.0.1", 25)

-- Multiple priorities
local prioritize = {
    ["STEAM_0:1:33459672"] = 100,
    ["steam:110000103fd1bb1"] = 10,
    ["ip:127.0.0.1"] = 25,
}
Queue.AddPriority(prioritize)
```

### ‚ùå RemovePriority

Removes priority from a player.

```lua
Queue.RemovePriority("STEAM_0:1:33459672")
```

### ‚úÖ IsReady

Checks if the queue's exports are ready to be used.

```lua
print(Queue.IsReady())
```

### üõ°Ô∏è GetPlayerRole

This export function allows you to retrieve the current role of a player in the game, based on their Discord ID.

```lua
-- Using player src (server ID)
local role, points = exports.connectqueue:GetPlayerRole(1) -- assuming '1' is a valid player src
if role then
    print("Player's Role: " .. role)
    print("Role Points: " .. points)
else
    print("Role not found or invalid player src.")
end

-- Using Discord ID
local role, points = exports.connectqueue:GetPlayerRole("discord:320015606071951360")
if role then
    print("Player's Role: " .. role)
    print("Role Points: " .. points)
else
    print("Role not found or invalid Discord ID.")
end

```
- as command
    ```lua
    RegisterCommand("checkrole", function(source, args, rawCommand)
        local targetPlayer = tonumber(args[1])
        if not targetPlayer then
            print("You must specify a player ID.")
            return
        end

        local role, points = exports.connectqueue:GetPlayerRole(targetPlayer)
        if role then
            print("Player " .. targetPlayer .. " has the role: " .. role .." "..points)
        else
            print("Could not retrieve the role for player " .. targetPlayer)
        end
    end, false)
    ```
### üîç Other Queue Functions

Access various queue functions via `sh_queue.lua`.

```lua
local ids = Queue.Exports:GetIds(src)

-- Set player to position 1 in the queue
Queue.Exports:SetPos(ids, 1)
-- Check if the player has any priority
Queue.Exports:IsPriority(ids)
-- Get the current queue size
Queue.Exports:GetSize()
-- And more...
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Discord Whitelist and Role Priority

To enable Discord Whitelist with support for the latest Discord API, update `sv_queue_config.lua` (lines 71 to 85) in the `server` directory:

```lua
Config.enableDiscordWhitelist = true -- Enable Discord whitelist system
Config.discordServerGuild = ""       -- Discord Server ID to check membership
Config.discordBotToken = ""          -- Discord Bot Token, create at https://discord.com/developers/applications

Config.Roles = {
    member = {
        roleID = "",  -- Role ID
        point = 15,   -- Queue priority points (higher points move the player up in the queue)
    },
    vip = {
        roleID = "",  -- Role ID
        point = 20,   -- Queue priority points (higher points move the player up in the queue)
    },
}
```
